 *  WCET Benchmark created by Andreas Ermedahl, Uppsala university, 
 *  May 2000.  
 *
 *  The purpose of this benchmark is to have two loop where the inner 
 *  loops max number of iterations depends on the outer loops current 
 *  iterations.  The results corresponds to something Jannes flow-analysis 
 *  should produce.
 *
 * The example appeard for the first time in: 
 * 
 *  @InProceedings{Ermedahl:Annotations,
 * author =       "A. Ermedahl and J. Gustafsson",
 * title =        "Deriving Annotations for Tight Calculation of Execution Time",
 * year =         1997,
 * month =        aug,
 * booktitle =    EUROPAR97,
 * publisher =    "Springer Verlag",
 * pages =        "1298-1307"
 * }
 *
 * The result of Jannes tool is something like:
 *   outer loop:       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11 
 *   inner loop max:   5   9   8   7   4   2   1   1   1   1    1
