   *          1. Completely structured.                                    *
   *               - There are no unconditional jumps.                     *
   *               - There are no exit from loop bodies.                   *
   *                 (There are no 'break' or 'return' in loop bodies)     *
   *          2. No 'switch' statements.                                   *
   *          3. No 'do..while' statements.                                *
   *          4. Expressions are restricted.                               *
   *               - There are no multiple expressions joined by 'or',     *
   *                'and' operations.                                      *
   *          5. No library calls.                                         *
   *               - All the functions needed are implemented in the       *
